        <p>I have been self studying the Japanese Language <br>
        for the last 6 months. It has been a difficult yet <br>
        incredibly rewarding journey so far. </p>

            <p>I've enjoyed video games as a source of entertainment <br>
            since I was a young child. My favorite genre would have to be <br>
            RPG's (role playing games). Their long 40-50 storylines <br>
            allow for a deeper connection to characters than a standard <br>
            90 minute movie ever could.</p>

            <p>Definitely the basis for starting my journey of learning the <br>
            Japanese language in my spare time. Japanese animation is incredibly <br>
            detailed in its action and its colors, and is such a treat to watch. <br>
            Manga, the Japanese equivalent of comics, are often the basis for <br>
            many successful animes and are full of a eide variety of different <br>
            fantasy and adventure stories.  </p>
