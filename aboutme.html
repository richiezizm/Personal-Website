        <h2><u>Welcome! </u></h2>
        <br>
            <h3>My name is Rich. I'm currently a FullStack Academy student <br> 
                studying Web Development. I also work full time for Amazon as a Level 3 Robotics Team Supervisor. <br>
                <br>
                I'm also currently studying <b><i>Amazon Web Services</i></b> in my free time. I recently completed and <br>
                obtained my certification for <b><i>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</i></b> in July 2023. My next goal <br>
                is to pursue a Solutions Architect Associate Certification, followed by either a Developer's Associate <br>
                or a specialty in Data Analytics. Or maybe both at some point!
                <br>
                <br>
                Problem Solving and Data Analytics are fundamental in my career, but I have also learned to enjoy them in <br>
                my everyday hobbies and interests as well. I enjoy exploring and uncovering the "why" behind work trends and <br>
                finding creative solutions for problems.
